<h2>Life Is Like A Box Of Chocolates </h2>

<p>“Life is like a box of chocolates, so enjoy every bite before its finished” - Coco Brown</p>
<p>Since first opening its doors in 2000,Coco’s Chocolatiers  has set out to be known for creating first class mouth-watering chocolate infused dishes served up each day by our staff known as the Chocolatiers. Placed in Ottawa’s Byward Market, we has been the favourite Chocolate restaurant for the past decade.
Meet Coco Brown, the woman behind this coco foundation.  She, from humble beginnings in Orleans,  a town situated in the east end of Ottawa; had her dreams realized by using  milk chocolate to create a number of dishes  and creating a restaurant of love which continues to thrive to this day.</p>
